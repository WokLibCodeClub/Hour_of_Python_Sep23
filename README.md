# Introduction to coding in Python - September 2023

We are going to introduce Python to beginner coders this session using a *trinket* tutorial called **Hour of Python**. This starts off using Python graphics, so it shows similarities to Scratch, which many beginner coders will already be familiar with.

The link to the front page of **Hour of Python** is

For our first session, on Saturday 30 September 2023, we will use a slightly edited version of step 1 which students will *Remix* in their trinket accounts. The link to that step is

### Rules for naming your Python variables:
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _ ). No SPACES allowed.
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character - never a number
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- We can’t use reserved keywords as a variable name (see below)
- We should avoid using names of Python functions, eg int, input, str

To find the list of reserved keywords go to the trinket Python console [trinket.io/console](https://trinket.io/console)

and type (you don't have to type the >>>):

```python
>>> import keyword
>>> keyword.kwlist
```

### Make your own versions of the Hour of Python programmes

If you want to remix any of the trinket projects in Hour of Python, so you have a version of your own in your trinket account, you can find all the links [here](./Hour_of_Python_links.md)

### Link to trinket project for introducing lists

In our second session we will be using a trinket project to introduce *lists*. The link to the trinket project is

We will also use the trinket *Python console* which you can open with this link

### Python project suggestions from Raspberry Pi website

Here are a couple of Python projects you might want to try out at home:

The first one doesn't use trinket, it uses the new Raspberry Pi Python editor, so to be able to save your code you will need a Raspberry Pi account. You can make one by going to [this link](https://my.raspberrypi.org/signup). If you are under 13 you should get an adult to go through the procedure with you. You will need an email address, and you will also need to respond to a verification email which will be sent to that address.

[Hello world](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/hello-world)

The second suggestion runs using trinket so you can use your existing account:
