# Summary of Python session on 28th October 2023

### Recap of ```for``` loop

We started looking at the [List of numbers](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/repeating-with-loops-and-lists/lists-of-numbers) task from the Hour of Python tutorial to study the way a Python ```for``` loop is constructed:

1. the word ```for```
2. a variable - you can choose the name, but here they use ```number```
3. the word ```in```
4. a list (here it is a list of numbers but you can use any list)
5. a colon ```:``` at the end of the line
6. all the lines of code which you want to repeat must be ***indented***

We recalled that if you want a Python ```for``` loop to run a set number of times you simply need a list containing that number of items.

### Practise writing a ```for``` loop

Next we went to a starter project [Moving tina](https://trinket.io/python/383a4b9b63) where we wrote code to make a turtle go round a square shape twice. We wanted to reduce all the lines of code for moving the turtle to just three lines, using a ```for``` loop.

Work out 1) what lines of code are being repeated; 2) how many times those lines are repeated; 3) write a ```for``` loop to do the same task with just three lines of code - refer to the Hour of Python task to guide you. Try to do this yourself before looking at the solution.

```python
for n in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:
  tina.forward(50)
  tina.left(90)
```

### Python ```range()``` function

If you wanted to repeat code 100 or 1000 times it would be ridiculous to type a list containing that many items, so Python has a function called ```range()``` which generates an automatic list. We opened the trinket [Python console](https://trinket.io/console) to investigate the ```range()``` function.

Type ```range()``` with a number in the brackets and press Enter. Look at the list which is generated. Experiment with a different number. Can you see the pattern?

Now type ```range()``` with two numbers in the brackets separated by a comma, and press Enter. The first number should be smaller. What is happening now? Can you work out what the numbers are doing? Example: ```range(5,20)```

Now type ```range()``` with three numbers in the brackets separated by a commas, and press Enter. The first number should be smaller than the second, and the third number should also be small. What is happening now? Can you work out what the numbers are doing? Example: ```range(5,20,2)```

Challenge: use ```range()``` with three numbers in the brackets to make this list:

```python
[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
```

```python
range(10,-1,-1)
