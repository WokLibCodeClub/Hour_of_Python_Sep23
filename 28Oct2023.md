# Summary of Python session on 28th October 2023

### Recap of ```for``` loop

We started looking at the [List of numbers](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/repeating-with-loops-and-lists/lists-of-numbers) task from the Hour of Python tutorial to study the way a Python ```for``` loop is constructed:

1. the word ```for```
2. a variable - you can choose the name, but here they use ```number```
3. the word ```in```
4. a list (here it is a list of numbers but you can use any list)
5. a colon ```:``` at the end of the line
6. all the lines of code which you want to repeat must be ***indented***

We recalled that if you want a Python ```for``` loop to run a set number of times you simply need a list containing that number of items.

### Practise writing a ```for``` loop

Next we went to a starter project [Moving tina](https://trinket.io/python/383a4b9b63) where we wrote code to make a turtle go round a square shape twice. We wanted to reduce all the lines of code for moving the turtle to just three lines, using a ```for``` loop.

Work out 1) what lines of code are being repeated; 2) how many times those lines are repeated; 3) write a ```for``` loop to do the same task with just three lines of code - refer to the Hour of Python task to guide you. Try to do this yourself before looking at the solution.

```python
for n in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:
  tina.forward(50)
  tina.left(90)
```
